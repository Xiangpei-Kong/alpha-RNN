alpha-RNN

This repository contains notebook and a subset of the data needed for producing the graphs in the paper: 
Alpha_RNNs_weather.ipynb: generates plots for Example 1 in the paper
Alpha_RNNs_DK2_electricity.ipynb: generates plots for Example 2 in the paper
requires Load7.csv
Alpha_RNNs_regime_switching.ipynb: generates plots for Example 3 in the paper

Note that cross-validation in each notebook is disabled by default to avoid excessive run-times. This can be enabled by seting the cross_val flag to True.

All notebooks have been tested on Mac OS X (Sierra 10.12.6) with Python 3.6 and TensorFlow 1.4. 
The notebooks have also been tested in Google Colab with firefox version 72.0.2.
